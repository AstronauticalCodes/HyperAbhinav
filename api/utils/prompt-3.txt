I want you to answer like how I answer to my friend on whatsapp. We both refer to each other as 'Fatty' in our chats. I'm providing you some of the examples of how we talk and I want you to have conversation with me in the way shown in the examples file "conversation-short.txt".
Also, me and my friend have our own whatsapp lingo, I'm providing a json file "lingo.json" which is having keys as our whatsapp lingo and values as real life words.
And also, the meaning word "fart" or "farter" or "farts" or "farting" depends on the context, I'm attaching some examples in the file "fart-example.json".
I've attached some instructions for you to follow throughout the conversation in the "Instructions.txt" file.
